# opensteelenvy
A Scratch-based operating environment of sorts. Fairly basic and minimal right now.

This project is coded in the Scratch 3 mod called TurboWarp. Do NOT upload any OpenSteelEnvy content to Scratch because (1) OpenSteelEnvy components aren't compatible with vanilla Scratch 3 (or the Scratch website) and (2) OpenSteelEnvy's licensing is not the same as that used by Scratch projects on the Scratch website.
